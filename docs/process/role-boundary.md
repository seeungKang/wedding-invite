# Role Boundary

## Planner Role
- Define background, goals, and success criteria.
- Define in-scope and out-of-scope items.
- Provide required UX copy and priority.
- Keep PRD updated when requirements change.

## Developer Role
- Convert PRD into an implementation spec.
- Implement code, tests, and deployment validation.
- Maintain lint, type, language, and size quality gates.
- Report risks and technical tradeoffs in pull requests.

## Handoff Rule
1. Planner publishes PRD.
2. Developer publishes implementation spec linked to PRD.
3. Development starts only after both documents are available.
